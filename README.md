# Structured Pruning for Neural Audio Effects

The code in this repository is part of an experiment evaluating different ways of doing structured pruning for a neural audio effect.

The code is organized as follows:

- `train/` contains Python scripts for training the neural networks.
- `pruning_experiments/` contains the source code for the pruning experiments.
- `plugin/` contains example code for an audio plugin with a network that can be pruned interactively.

Test builds of the plugin are available on the [Releases page](https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/neural-pruning/releases).
